                <p>
                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive
                    (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more
                    advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more
                    functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple
                    computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to
                    the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of
                    language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be
                    extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and
                        its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to
                        place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and
                        page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running
                        JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate
                        with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the
                        application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </article>

                    <p>
                        JavaScript applications consist of statements with an appropriate syntax. A single statement may
                        span multiple lines. Multiple statements may occur on a single line if each statement is
                        separated by a semicolon. This isn't a keyword, but a group of keywords.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:
                            <code>
                                var a, b, c; // Declare 3 variables
                                a = 5; // Assign the value 5 to a
                                b = 6; // Assign the value 6 to b
                                c = a + b; // Assign the sum of a and b to c
                            </code>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed:
                            <code>
                                a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;
                            </code>
                        </li>

                        JavaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed:
                        <code>
                            var x, y, z; // Declare Variables
                            x = 5; y = 6; // Assign Values
                            z = x + y; // Compute Values
                        </code>

                </header>
                <p>
                    JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.

                    JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Single line comments start with //.

                        Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be
                        executed).

                        This example uses a single-line comment before each code line:
                        <code>
                            // Change heading:
                            document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";

                            // Change paragraph:
                            document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
                        </code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.

                        Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.

                        This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code:
                        <code>
                            /*
                            The code below will change
                            the heading with id = "myH"
                            and the paragraph with id = "myP"
                            in my web page:
                            */
                            document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
                            document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
                        </code>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values.

                    In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:
                    <code>
                        var x = 5;
                        var y = 6;
                        var z = x + y;
                    </code>
                </p>
            </section>

                    Operators
                </header>
                <p>
                    The assignment operator (=) assigns a value to a variable.
                    <code>
                        var x = 10;
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The addition operator (+) adds numbers:
                    <code>
                        var x = 5;
                        var y = 2;
                        var z = x + y;
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The multiplication operator (*) multiplies numbers.
                    <code>
                        var x = 5;
                        var y = 2;
                        var z = x * y;
                    </code>

                    Arithmetic operators perform arithmetic on numbers (literals or variables).

                    Data Types
                </header>
                <p>
                    In programming, data types is an important concept.

                    To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type.

                    Without data types, a computer cannot safely solve this:
                    <code>
                        var x = 16 + "Volvo";
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Does it make any sense to add "Volvo" to sixteen? Will it produce an error or will it produce a
                    result?

                    JavaScript will treat the example above as:
                    <code>
                        var x = "16" + "Volvo";
                    </code>
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <header>
                    Functions
                </header>
                <p>
                    A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by
                    parentheses ().

                    Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

                    The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
                    (parameter1, parameter2, ...)

                    The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

                </p>
                <p>
                    Function Invocation
                    The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

                    When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
                    When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
                    Automatically (self invoked)
                </p>
                <p>
                    When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.

                    If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the
                    invoking statement.

                    Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":
                </p>

                    Objects
                </header>
                <p>
                    You have already learned that JavaScript variables are containers for data values.

                    This code assigns a simple value (Fiat) to a variable named car:
                    <code>
                        var car = "Fiat";
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.

                    This code assigns many values (Fiat, 500, white) to a variable named car:
                    <code>
                        var car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};
                    </code>
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <header>
                    Events
                </header>
                <p>
                    Here are some examples of HTML events:

                    An HTML web page has finished loading
                    An HTML input field was changed
                    An HTML button was clicked
                    Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

                    JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

                    HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p> In the following example, an onclick attribute (with code), is added to a <button> element:
                        </p>
                        <code>
                            <button onclick="document.getElementById('demo').innerHTML = Date()">The time is?</button>
                        </code>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the example above, the JavaScript code changes the content of the element with id="demo".

                        In the next example, the code changes the content of its own element (using this.innerHTML):
                        <code>
                            <button onclick="this.innerHTML = Date()">The time is?</button>
                        </code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
